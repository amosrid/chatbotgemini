""Hai python" -  Okay, that's a fun way to say hello to Python!  It sounds like you're already familiar with the language at some level.  To best help you, tell me a bit more about your existing Python experience.  Have you worked with any specific libraries or frameworks before (like Django, Flask, NumPy, Pandas)?  Have you tackled any projects?  The more I know about your background, the better I can tailor our sessions.  We can delve into more advanced concepts or go back to the basics depending on your current skill level.  Let's chat!"<br>""
